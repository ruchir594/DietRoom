787839710307586048,2016-10-17 02:16:38,@jackiehluo Trump's racism and sexism disgust me. But the way to make it better is not to shun all his supporters. We need the opposite.
787839280999575552,2016-10-17 02:14:56,@EricaJoy And sometimes a position a candidate holds is so abhorrent it feels impossible to consider anything else.

787835233521377280,2016-10-17 01:58:51,9) Sometimes the hardest and most important thing is to sit down with a friend and try to teach instead of yelling.

787834646461452292,2016-10-17 01:56:31,6) Diversity of opinion is painful but critical to the health of a democratic society. We can't start purging people for political support.
787834522180079616,2016-10-17 01:56:02,5) Cutting off opposing viewpoints leads to extremism and will not get us the country we want.
787834428064083968,2016-10-17 01:55:39,"4) We need to talk to each other more, not less.  Most people think roughly half the country is severely misguided."

787834278478422016,2016-10-17 01:55:03,3) Thiel is a high profile supporter of Trump. I disagree with this. YC is not going to fire someone for supporting a major party nominee.

568229372911431680,2015-02-19 02:03:34,"7) anyway, founders would do well to remember that having an almost comically low burn in the early days work more often than the opposite"

568228671879688192,2015-02-19 02:00:47,4) and seed money is so easy to raise in the current environment that founders assume they can just raise more money whenever they want

568228430291955712,2015-02-19 01:59:49,2) it ends up being especially bad for startups where either the founders need big salaries or are non-technical and need to hire right away

527958131775504384,2014-10-30 23:00:02,today @levie spoke about how to build an enterprise company! http://t.co/gayeXGuZcm
527943712710459392,2014-10-30 22:02:44,twice in the last day i've been asked by reporters if it's true that accelerators ex-YC lose money as a whole. would be very surprised if so

527248555526737920,2014-10-29 00:00:26,"@feynmanrocks @ycombinator i did the math on that.  it would take minimum 2,000 hours to provide thoughtful feedback to everyone."
527247972883386368,2014-10-28 23:58:07,"also, the commonly-cited 4000 tech startups per year that would like to raise money per year is clearly a major underestimate"
